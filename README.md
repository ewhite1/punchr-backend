#Punchr

Punchr is an application is a basic employee time card administration.

This is the backend only part of punchr. While the rails app has some frontend, this is mostly for testing purposes, and 
a separate git repo will be available for web frontend and mobile applications.

Punchr backend is based upon rails api. 

This is my first large project, which will test my programming skills I've been working on for the past two years. Any suggestions are welcome! 

some notes: 
- for development, sqlite is used, and PostgreSQL in production. This is to allow compatibility with Heroku.
